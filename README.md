### Personal writing site using Eleventy using [Dan Urbanowicz](https://www.danurbanowicz.com/)

Learning Nunjucks and a bit of JavaScript along the way. I want something I can evovle overtime 
and something that won't stress the hell out of me.


# Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate

## [Demo Site](https://eleventy-netlify-boilerplate.netlify.app/)

## What is it?

A simple template for building a fast, pre-generated HTML website using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator. With [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) baked-in, ready to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in a couple of clicks.

Use it as a starter for your own JAMstack projects, or as an easy way to get started building websites with Eleventy.

Based on the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) repo (see there for additional info on Eleventy usage).
